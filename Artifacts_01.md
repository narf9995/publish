## Wondrous & Cursed Tomes

In the half-light of guttering candles—where dust settles thick upon forsaken vaults—lie tomes of *whispered power*; veiled in secrecy, and steeped in doom. Their pages murmur truths both *hallowed* and *profane*, offering wisdom with a blade pressed to the throat: its razor edge glinting with *promise* and *peril* alike. Those who dare to read find themselves forever changed—*for knowledge, once grasped, is a weight that **cannot** be put down*.

### Overview

Below is a ranked list of books, ordered by their potential impact on the campaign:

1. **The Cryptonomicon** – Provides secure communication but does not significantly alter gameplay.  
2. **The Miser’s Ledger** – Grants financial insight, with potential for greed-based character consequences.  
3. **The Pathfinder’s Log** – Expedites travel but introduces minor risks of misdirection.  
4. **The Reflected Lexicon** – Enables real-time observation, but occasionally disrupts expectations.  
5. **The Glutinous Grimoire** – Grants powerful spells at the cost of growing demands, possibly altering character motivations.  
6. **The Necrological Register** – Can reveal knowledge from the dead, with escalating consequences and potential undead interference.  
7. **The Book of Hollow Oaths** – Imposes magical contracts that enforce oaths, with severe consequences for breaking them.  
8. **The Unraveling Codex** – Answers any question but increases madness risk, leading to drastic character shifts and potentially death.  
9. **Codicil of the Bibliophage** – Amplifies magic but consumes knowledge, potentially erasing vital tomes and reshaping the world’s understanding.  
10. **The Almanac of the False Sun** – Alters celestial reality itself, eventually shifting the world or transporting characters elsewhere.

### 1 – The Cryptonomicon

> A pair of heavy, dwarven-forged tomes, their surfaces bristling with intricate mechanisms. Within, shifting glyphs form cryptic passages, their meanings obscured. Only two pages remain blank: the first and the last.

When a message is inscribed upon the first page, it vanishes instantly, reappearing—transformed into an unbreakable cipher—on the last page of the same book. The encrypted text must then be transcribed and delivered through conventional means, ensuring that even if intercepted, its meaning remains impenetrable.

Possession of the second tome allows the encoded words to be decrypted, making the pair invaluable for secure long-distance communication. Yet a single tome still holds utility—its owner may encrypt messages for later decryption, though at the cost of convenience, as the book itself must be physically retrieved to reveal its secrets.

### 2 – The Miser’s Ledger

> A ledger of insatiable hunger, its ink steeped in the grasping dread of a merchant who bartered beyond mortal means. It knows the gravity of coin, the echo of debts unclaimed. To gaze upon its script is to reckon wealth as the gods do—not as minted metal, but as dominion yet to be seized.

Once per day, a reader may determine whether any financial venture is profitable, revealing its scale, risk, and ultimate outcome. Yet those who linger too long over its columns and margins find their thoughts consumed by acquisition. Each reading carries a **1-in-6** chance of igniting an insatiable greed—an obsession that reduces all else to numbers on a ledger.

### 3 – The Pathfinder’s Log

> Its pages, dog-eared and ink-stained, unravel journeys through lands that twist and fade—some known, others lost to time. Many voices whisper within, or perhaps one mind, fractured and scattered across the pages. Each entry sinks deeper into madness, with cryptic warnings scrawled in the margins: *these paths do not always lead where they should*.

A reader gains an intuitive sense of direction, halving the time needed to traverse unknown terrain. Yet the book does not merely *reveal* the way—it *dictates* it. There is a **1-in-6** chance the chosen path serves another's will, leading to peril or unseen consequence, as determined by the GM.

### 4 – The Reflected Lexicon

> Bound in glass, its translucent pages shimmer like still water—waiting, watching. Reflections ripple across the surface, though no hand has turned them. To gaze upon its pages is to glimpse the world as it was, as it is... or as something else remembers it. *Distance dissolves; the watcher is no longer absent.*

When opened, each page reveals a perfect image of a place or person the reader has seen before, allowing them to observe from afar in real-time.

However, every **1-in-6** readings, the book refuses to obey. It shows not what the reader seeks, but something else entirely. Perhaps a hidden danger. Perhaps a long-forgotten memory. Or perhaps—*perhaps*—the reader themselves, framed in glass; the observer subsumed, reduced to the seen.

### 5 – The Glutinous Grimoire

> Its pages, yellowed and brittle, remain blank, their surface untouched by time’s hand—until they are fed. Only when an offering is made does the ink begin to breathe, words coiling and slithering across the parchment, scribed by an unseen hand. The more that is given, the more the Grimoire demands, until it has consumed all that its reader is willing to offer—and perhaps more.

Drip the blood of a magical beast upon the parchment, and ink blossoms forth, revealing lost spells and forgotten arcana. Yet not all knowledge is a gift. Should mundane blood be offered instead, there is a **3-in-6** chance the revealed spell is warped—its form twisted, its consequences dire. The more it is fed, the deeper its hunger grows, until mere drops no longer suffice.

### 6 – The Necrological Register

> A tome bound in brittle leather, its pages yellowed like ancient bone. It exhales the scent of dust and devotion—prayers unsaid, rituals unbroken, a covenant neither made nor forsaken. Its leaves crackle at the touch, not in decay, but in recognition. It does not preserve memory—it *extracts* it, binding thoughts in ink where flesh has failed.

When laid upon the remains of the dead, its blank parchment ingests the lingering whispers of the departed. The more complete the skeleton, the clearer the transcription—fractured bones yield fragmented thoughts, while a pristine skull may pour forth a coherent confession.

Yet, the Register does not merely record. Each use stirs the bones, awakening echoes of the soul once housed within. Incomplete remains *beg*, their thoughts jumbled, their memories lost in time’s decay. Some entries end abruptly, as if the speaker were *interrupted*. Each use risks *stirring* what lies beneath, for some voices do not fade willingly.

Should one inscribe their own name within its pages, the text remains *blank*—until the day their body joins the dust.

### 7 – The Book of Hollow Oaths

> Bound in cracked vellum, its cover bears no title—only the deep impressions of hands that have pressed against it in desperation. Within, its pages remain blank until an oath is sworn upon them, at which point the words etch themselves into the parchment, written in the speaker’s own blood.

Once inscribed, the vow *must* be upheld, for the book itself ensures compliance. At first, the reminders are subtle: a whisper in the night, a trembling of the hands, a sudden dread when straying from one’s word.

But as the oath is broken, the pages darken, the ink shifting into something *alive*. Those who forsake their vows entirely find their names vanishing—not just from the book, but from *memory itself*.

Some claim that if one fills its final page, the book seals itself, an unyielding testament to the oaths sworn within. Yet none who have done so remain to confirm—whether lost to consequence, erased from memory, or bound forever within its pages.

### 8 – The Unraveling Codex

> A tome of impossible geometry, bound in ink-black leather. The text within is mutable, twisting and reforming to answer the reader’s questions. Yet truth, once known, is not easily forgotten.

Each reading fully answers one question, revealing knowledge beyond mortal comprehension. However, each revelation courts madness: the chance of permanent insanity begins at **1-in-6** and increases with every subsequent reading—until, inevitably, the reader is lost.

Some scholars speak of an alternative: *The Silent Codex*. This variant does not erode the mind, but the soul. Each truth learned strips away a form of communication: first speech, then writing, then gesture. To lose all three is a fate worse than death—a mind teeming with knowledge, utterly incapable of sharing it.

### 9 – Codicil of the Bibliophage

> In the shadow of Babel, where tongues were torn asunder, this ancient edict hungers for language. To read its pages is to feed its insatiable thirst—each word consumed, torn from the fabric of reality, and erased from the annals of memory. What is gained in power is lost in meaning, and as the pages dwindle, so too does the world’s understanding. In the end, when all words have been devoured and no trace of knowledge remains, only hunger endures, eternal and unfed.

Reading from this tome before another greatly amplifies any book-based magic—doubling, even tripling its potency. Yet each time it is used, it devours the empowered book, reducing it to brittle, ash-stained pages.

Worse still, if left among other tomes for an hour, there is a **1-in-6** chance that the most valuable book in the collection (excluding itself) is destroyed. This effect repeats *hourly* until the Codicil is removed; its hunger is never sated, inexorably consuming everything within its reach.

It is often found alone, the last surviving remnant in a library of hollowed, desiccated husks. Yet, to a more discerning eye, it is not a survivor—*these* are its victims, devoured and forgotten, their knowledge consumed by the insatiable maw of the Codicil.

### 10 – The Almanac of the False Sun  

> An exquisite folio, bound in deep blue leather embossed with golden constellations—none of which match the sky above. Its pages overflow with precise charts, celestial coordinates, and planetary movements. It is an astronomer’s dream—save for one flaw. *The sky it describes does not exist.*  

The stars within bear unfamiliar names, their constellations twisted into patterns unseen by mortal scholars. It speaks of eclipses that never came, of planets whose orbits do not align with the firmament, of a cosmos where time flows to the rhythm of an unseen hand. And yet… its predictions often *prove true*, as if the heavens themselves must bend to match its text.  

Each time the Almanac is consulted to predict a celestial event, roll a **1d6**:  

- On a **1-5**, the prediction is accurate, revealing an eclipse, an auspicious alignment, or the perfect moment to act.  
- On a **6**, the Almanac does not merely predict the event—it *enforces* it. A celestial body vanishes or shifts in the sky, realigning the heavens to match its text. The change is subtle at first, but accumulates with continued use.  

Every **sixth** consultation, the Almanac ceases to reference the known sky at all. Instead, it describes the firmament of a place that does not exist—or *does not exist yet*. What follows is inevitable: the sky will change to match.  

Those who rely too long upon its guidance wake from strange dreams to find themselves beneath an unfamiliar firmament. The stars are not where they should be. The moons are wrong. And worst of all, they are no longer certain whether the sky has changed—or if they have simply *arrived somewhere else*.

## Conclusion

This collection began as a series of improvisations in the Ward Against Evil development channel, where ideas sparked and spiraled into the strange and arcane. The author of the project suggested I release these under my own name—so here we are.

If you haven’t yet, go explore their work. *Crowns 1e/2e* and *Aketon* rank among my favorite OSR releases in recent years. You can find their official publisher page at **ward-against-evil.itch.io**.

This is intended to be the first of many such collections. Future editions will expand upon this theme, released in blog, print, and source-controlled formats. All text, code, and diagrams (except for artwork) are published under **CC-BY 4.0**, unless otherwise noted.
